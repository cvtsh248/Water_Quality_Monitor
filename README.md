# Water Quality Monitor

This is an affordable, work-in-progress arduino based system that rates/monitors changes in water quality over a period of time. The system could potentially be used to monitor/rate the changes in tap water over time. When a significant change occurs, the system alerts the user. A change in water quality could indicate some form of contamination. 

The system currently monitors total dissolved solids (TDS) and turbidity using homemade sensors. More information is provided in the [wiki](https://github.com/cvtsh248/Water_Quality_Monitor/wiki). 

# Components Required
More information regarding the construction of the sensors and circuitry is in the [wiki](https://github.com/cvtsh248/Water_Quality_Monitor/wiki).
