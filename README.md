# Water Quality Monitor

This is an affordable, work-in-progress arduino based system that rates/monitors changes in water quality over a period of time. The system could potentially be used to monitor/rate the changes in tap water over time. When a significant change occurs, the system should alert the user. A change in water quality could indicate some form of contamination.

The system currently monitors total dissolved solids (TDS) and turbidity using homemade sensors. More information will be provided in the wiki (coming soon). 

# Components Required
More information regarding the construction of the sensors and circuitry will be in the wiki (coming soon).
* Computer with functional USB ports.
* Arduino UNO (This is the model I used, but any Arduino should work)
* Resistors (10k立, 3.3k立, 100立, 20k立), note that you may need resistors of other values, more information will be provided in the wiki (coming soon) 
* Wire
* Red LED (for the turbidity sensor)
* Light Dependent Resistor (for the turbidity sensor)
* Bottle Cap (For turbidity sensor, more info in the wiki)
* Plugpoint with two functional prongs (for the TDS sensor)
