# Water_Quality_Monitor

This is a work-in-progress arduino based system that rates/monitors water over a period of time. The system could potentially be used to monitor/rate the changes in tap water. When a significant change occurs, the system should alert the user. The user may then know that there may be something wrong with their tap water.
